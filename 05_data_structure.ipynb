    "### **5. How would you reverse a string in Python without using built-in functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer in simple words:**\n",
    "Reversing a string means writing it from the last character to the first. Without built-in functions, we can use a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-life examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imagine reading a book from the last page back to the first.\n",
    "2. If your name is on a paper as **CHIRAG**, reversing gives **GARHIC** (reading backward).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Coding example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = \"Python\"\n",
    "reversed_text = \"\"\n",
    "for char in text:\n",
    "    reversed_text = char + reversed_text\n",
    "print(reversed_text)   # Output: nohtyP\n",

    "### **6. Explain string immutability in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer in simple words:**\n",
    "Strings cannot be changed once created. If you try to modify, Python creates a new string instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-life examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Think of writing your name on stone. If you want to change it, you need a new stone.\n",
    "2. A printed book page cannot be edited—you must reprint a new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Coding example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"Hello\"\n",
    "s = s + \" World\"   # New string created\n",
    "print(s)           # Output: Hello World\n",
    "```\n",

    "### **7. What are the advantages of using lists in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer in simple words:**\n",
    "Lists can store many items together, in order, and can be changed anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-life examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A shopping list: you can add, remove, or change items.\n",
    "2. A playlist of songs: you can rearrange, add new songs, or delete old ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Coding example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "fruits.append(\"mango\")\n",
    "print(fruits)   # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango']\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. How are Python sets different from lists and tuples?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer in simple words:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lists/Tuples** → Keep order, can have duplicates.\n",
    "* **Sets** → Do not keep order, and automatically remove duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-life examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **set of colors** in a paint box—no repeats.\n",
    "2. A **list of students in class** may have duplicates if someone is counted twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Coding example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3}\n",
    "print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(my_set)   # {1, 2, 3}\n",

    "### **9. What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in lists?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer in simple words:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shallow copy** → Copies only the outer list, not inner lists.\n",
    "* **Deep copy** → Copies everything, including inner lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-life examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shallow copy: photocopying a file cover but leaving old papers inside.\n",
    "2. Deep copy: photocopying both the cover and every page inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Coding example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "list1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n",
    "\n",
    "shallow = copy.copy(list1)\n",
    "deep = copy.deepcopy(list1)\n",
    "\n",
    "list1[0][0] = 9\n",
    "print(shallow)  # [[9, 2], [3, 4]]\n",
    "print(deep)     # [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n",

    "### **10. When would you use a dictionary over a list?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer in simple words:**\n",
    "Use a dictionary when you want to store data as **key-value pairs** for fast lookup. Use a list for simple ordered items.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-life examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dictionary → Phonebook: {\"John\": 98765, \"Sara\": 12345}.\n",
    "2. List → Shopping items: \\[\"milk\", \"bread\", \"eggs\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Coding example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "phonebook = {\"John\": 98765, \"Sara\": 12345}\n",
    "print(phonebook[\"John\"])   # Output: 98765\n",

    "### **11. How do you merge two dictionaries in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer in simple words:**\n",
    "We can combine two dictionaries into one using `update()` or `{**dict1, **dict2}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Real-life examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Merging two contact lists from two phones.\n",
    "2. Combining two recipe books into one big recipe book.\n",

    "dict1 = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
    "dict2 = {\"c\": 3, \"d\": 4}\n",
