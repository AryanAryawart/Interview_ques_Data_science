    "### 🔹 What is a Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is like a blueprint or template used to create objects.\n",
    "It defines **attributes (variables)** and **methods (functions)** that describe how an object should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **object** is an instance of a class.\n",
    "When you create something using a class, that \"something\" is the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Real-Life Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of **Class = Car Blueprint**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defines properties like `color`, `brand`, `speed`.\n",
    "* Defines methods like `start()`, `stop()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects** would be actual cars built from this blueprint, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Car 1 → Red BMW with speed 220\n",
    "* Car 2 → Blue Tesla with speed 250\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐍 Python Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a class (blueprint)\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, color, speed):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",

    "# Using the objects\n",
    "print(car1.drive())  # Red BMW is driving at 220 km/h\n",

    "## **2. Inheritance in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** allows a class (child) to use the **properties and methods** of another class (parent).\n",
    "This helps in **code reusability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parent (Base) Class** → Defines general attributes/methods.\n",
    "* **Child (Derived) Class** → Inherits from parent, can also add/override methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Real-Life Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parent class → Animal** (common features: `eat()`, `sleep()`).\n",
    "* **Child class → Dog** (inherits `eat()` and `sleep()` but also has `bark()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Dog can do everything Animal can, plus its own unique behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐍 Python Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Parent Class\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        return \"This animal is eating.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Child Class (inherits from Animal)\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof! Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "animal = Animal()\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(animal.eat())   # This animal is eating.\n",
    "print(dog.eat())      # Inherited method -> This animal is eating.\n",
    "print(dog.bark())     # Child class method -> Woof! Woof!\n",

    "### 🔹 Types of Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance** → One child inherits from one parent.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance** → One child inherits from multiple parents.\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance** → A child inherits from another child class (grandparent → parent → child).\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** → Multiple children inherit from the same parent.\n",
